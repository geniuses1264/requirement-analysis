# requirement-analysis
 Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository. This space is dedicated to understanding and documenting the foundational step in the software development life cycle-**requirement analysis**.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as a learning and documentation hub for exploring:
- The importance of gathering and analyzing requirements
- Types of requirements (functional, non-functional, etc.)
- Techniques and tools used in requirement analysis
- Real-world examples and use cases

Whether you're a student, developer, or project manager, this resource aims to provide clarity and structure around one of the most critical aspects of building successful software.

Feel free to contribute, raise issues, or fork this project to build upon it.

## 📘 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the goals, expectations, and constraints of a software project are identified, gathered, examined, and documented. It serves as the bridge between stakeholders (such as clients, users, business analysts) and the development team.

This process ensures that everyone involved has a clear, shared understanding of what the software system is supposed to do and how it should behave under different conditions.

### 🧠 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis lays the foundation for all subsequent phases of development. Without it, projects risk failure due to misunderstandings, scope creep, misaligned objectives, or unmet user needs.

Here’s why it matters:

- ✅ **Clarity of Vision**: It captures exactly what needs to be built.
- 🧭 **Direction for Development**: It provides developers with a precise roadmap.
- 🔄 **Efficient Resource Use**: Prevents unnecessary rework and miscommunication.
- 📊 **Basis for Testing**: Requirements are used to define test cases and validation criteria.
- 🤝 **Client Satisfaction**: Ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations.

### 🔁 Where It Fits in the SDLC

Requirement Analysis is usually the **second phase** of the SDLC, following the **Feasibility Study**, and preceding **System Design**. The process typically includes:

1. **Requirement Gathering** – via interviews, surveys, or observations.
2. **Requirement Documentation** – clearly outlining functional and non-functional needs.
3. **Validation** – ensuring the documented requirements are complete, feasible, and verifiable.
4. **Sign-off** – stakeholders agree on the finalized requirements.

### 🧰 Techniques Used

- User Interviews
- Use Case Diagrams
- User Stories
- Prototyping
- Brainstorming Sessions
- MoSCoW Prioritization

In short, **Requirement Analysis** is not just a phase—it's the compass that guides the entire development journey. A well-executed analysis saves time, minimizes risks, and elevates software quality.
